## Getting Started

Before going through the rest of this documentation, please take some time to read the [Package Development](https://laravel.com/docs/master/packages) section of Laravel's own documentation, if you haven't done so yet.

## Installation

To install through composer, simply put the following in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "orchestra/testbench": "~3.0"
    }
}
```

And then run `composer install` from the terminal.

### Quick Installation

Above installation can also be simplify by using the following command:

    composer require --dev "orchestra/testbench=~3.0"

## Usage

To use Testbench Component, all you need to do is extend `Orchestra\Testbench\TestCase` instead of `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase`. The fixture `app` booted by `Orchestra\Testbench\TestCase` is predefined to follow the base application skeleton of Laravel 5.

```php
<?php

class TestCase extends Orchestra\Testbench\TestCase
{
    //
}
```

### Custom Service Provider

To load your package service provider, override the `getPackageProviders`.

```php
protected function getPackageProviders($app)
{
    return ['Acme\AcmeServiceProvider'];
}
```

### Custom Aliases

To load your package alias, override the `getPackageAliases`.

```php
protected function getPackageAliases($app)
{
    return [
        'Acme' => 'Acme\Facade'
    ];
}
```

### Overriding setUp() method

Since `Orchestra\Testbench\TestCase` replace Laravel's `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase`, if you need your own `setUp()` implementation, do not forget to call `parent::setUp()`:

```php
/**
 * Setup the test environment.
 */
protected function setUp()
{
    parent::setUp();

    // Your code here
}
```

If you need to add something early in the application bootstrapping process, you could use the `getEnvironmentSetUp()` method:

```php
/**
 * Define environment setup.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Foundation\Application  $app
 * @return void
 */
protected function getEnvironmentSetUp($app)
{
    // Setup default database to use sqlite :memory:
    $app['config']->set('database.default', 'testbench');
    $app['config']->set('database.connections.testbench', [
        'driver'   => 'sqlite',
        'database' => ':memory:',
        'prefix'   => '',
    ]);
}
```

To reduce setup configuration, you could use `testing` database connection (`:memory:` with `sqlite` driver) via setting it up under `getEnvironmentSetUp()` or by defining it under PHPUnit Configuration File:

```xml
<phpunit>

    // ...

    <php>
        <env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="testing"/>
    </php>

</phpunit>
```

### Overriding Console Kernel

You can easily swap Console Kernel for application bootstrap by overriding `resolveApplicationConsoleKernel()` method:

```php
/**
 * Resolve application Console Kernel implementation.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Foundation\Application  $app
 * @return void
 */
protected function resolveApplicationConsoleKernel($app)
{
    $app->singleton('Illuminate\Contracts\Console\Kernel', 'Acme\Testbench\Console\Kernel');
}
```

### Overriding HTTP Kernel

You can easily swap HTTP Kernel for application bootstrap by overriding `resolveApplicationHttpKernel()` method:

```php
/**
 * Resolve application HTTP Kernel implementation.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Foundation\Application  $app
 * @return void
 */
protected function resolveApplicationHttpKernel($app)
{
    $app->singleton('Illuminate\Contracts\Http\Kernel', 'Acme\Testbench\Http\Kernel');
}
```

### Overriding Application Timezone

You can also easily override application default timezone, instead of the default `"UTC"`:

```php
/**
 * Get application timezone.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Foundation\Application  $app
 * @return string|null
 */
protected function getApplicationTimezone($app)
{
    return 'Asia/Kuala_Lumpur';
}
```

### Using Migrations

Package developer should be using `ServiceProvider::loadMigrationsFrom()` feature to automatically handle migrations for packages.

```php
$this->artisan('migrate', ['--database' => 'testbench'])->run();
```

#### Using Laravel Migrations

By default Testbench doesn't execute the default Laravel migrations which include `users` and `password_resets` table. In order to run the migration just add the following command:

```php
$this->loadLaravelMigrations();
```

You can also set specific database connection to be used by adding `--database` options:

```php
$this->loadLaravelMigrations(['--database' => 'testbench']);
```

#### Running Testing Migrations

To run migrations that are **only used for testing purposes** and not part of your package, add the following to your base test class:

```php
/**
 * Setup the test environment.
 */
protected function setUp()
{
    parent::setUp();

    $this->loadMigrationsFrom(__DIR__ . '/database/migrations');
    
    // and other test setup steps you need to perform
}
```

For Laravel versions below 5.6, you will need to register an additional ServiceProvider for your tests:

```php
/**
 * Get package providers.
 *
 * @param \Illuminate\Foundation\Application $app
 *
 * @return array
 */
protected function getPackageProviders($app)
{
    return [
        // Other ServiceProvider classes you need to register...
        \Orchestra\Database\ConsoleServiceProvider::class,
    ];
}
```

##### Notes and Considerations

* Your migration files has to suite Laravel's convention, e.g. `0000_00_00_000000_create_package_test_tables.php`.
* You may choose to put your migrations folder in `tests/database/`.
* You may choose to change your test-migrations class name to be different from the published class names, e.g. from `CreateUsersTable` to `CreateUsersTestTable` or otherwise you may encounter composer class loader collision.
 
### Using Model Factories

Testbench include `withFactories()` method to allow you to register custom model factory path for your test suite.

```php
$this->withFactories(__DIR__.'/factories');
```

## Example

To see a working example of testbench including how to set your configuration, check the file:

* [Testing with Database](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench-core/tree/3.6/tests/Databases).

## Alternative Testing

There also 3rd party packages that extends Testbench:

* [Testbench with Laravel Dusk](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench-dusk)
* [Testbench with BrowserKit](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench-browser-kit)
* [Testbench with CodeCeption](https://github.com/aedart/testing-laravel)
* [Testbench with PHPSpec](https://github.com/Pixelindustries/phpspec-testbench)

## Troubleshoot

### No supported encrypter found. The cipher and / or key length are invalid.

    RuntimeException: No supported encrypter found. The cipher and / or key length are invalid.

This error would only occur if your test suite require usages of the encrypter. To solve this you can add a dummy `APP_KEY` or use a specific key to your application/package `phpunit.xml`.

```xml
<phpunit>

    // ...

    <php>
        <env name="APP_KEY" value="AckfSECXIvnK5r28GVIWUAxmbBSjTsmF"/>
    </php>

</phpunit>
```

### Why Testbench doesn't include any of the `App` classes.

The reason Testbench remove all the classes is to make sure that you would never depends on it when developing Laravel Packages. Classes such as `App\Http\Controllers\Controller` and `App\User` are simple to be added but the problems with these classes is that it can be either:

* Removed, moved to other location such as `App\Models\User`, or
* Renamed using `php artisan app:name Acme` which would rename `App\User` to `Acme\User`.

### Missing Browser Kit support after testing on Laravel 5.4

Replace `orchestra/testbench` with `orchestra/testbench-browser-kit` and follow [the installation guide](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench-browser-kit#installation).
